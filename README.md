Final project of April 2020 Cohort

An app for people helping each other, paying with in-app currency (karma points). So in order to have people help you with stuff, you need to help others with stuff.

User can post a request for a certain task to be done. User can respond to requests and say that they can do it. They both agree on the reward. When the task is done the user that requested it pays the user that performed the task with in-app currency (karma points). Afterwards they can rate each other, so that trust-worthy people will get higher rating. A user needs an account in order to post and respond to requests.

User can browse the feed of tasks in the local area, by newest or category or....

```
As a community of people in the local area
In order to help each other within the area, making use of the skills and tools that exist in the area
People can register for an account to connect *people in need of help* with *people who has the resources and ability to help with the specific task*.
```

#### requester gets many responses
* list/collection with pending helpers, below or close to the specific pending request
* when clicked. opens chat window with that helper, option to accept or decline
#### helper is happy with the quest and checks OK - I'm up for it
#### requester is happy with the helper and checks OK - you're the one
* helper gets notification
#### quest is completed
* both mark 'quest completed' when job is done. Rewarding is done automatically - should be visible
* opportunity for rating after job is completed (inside of the chat window) (Comments as extra feature)
